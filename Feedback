The Feedback
# I am one of those people who looked at and used your calculator.
Considering you're only two months in your first year, I think this
is a good achievement for a beginner programmer. The calculator works
like any ordinary one, without errors and makes our life easier for us
to perform tasks such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division,
shows numbers under the root, takes out percentages, etc. An infinite
number of digits can be combed out. Great job! The feedback should be
provided on realistic grounds that keeps the window open for improvement.
Of course there is always somewhere to grow. You can change the design and
add more features. I wish you good luck and hope you will improve even further.

# For the first time this project is really good looking for your experience.
 But in the future, you need to improve your project that can solve much more
 complicated functions. I hope that by passing time you will get more experienced
 and skilled creating more decreased and other useful programs.

# Since I am studying at the chemistry department, the calculator has become an
essential device for me. This calculator has many useful operators that a simple
calculator does not. The interface is also interesting. It has a lot of colors and
colors change when you click on it, it's amazing. Overall a good project.
I wish you success in the future.

# The design of the project is good. All used colors look good.
There are many possibilities.  I would advise adding the ability to calculate not
only integers rational numbers too and change text color of numbers so that they
differ from operators. Everything else is very well done.
Good luck with your next projects.
